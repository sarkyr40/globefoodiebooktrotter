title: Escape to Santorini
---
Dear Santorini, you are like a woman who knows she has it all and the world is at her feet. Yet, we cant help but fall in love with you. You would think all that charm would be nauseating or some may call it cliche. Not by me, you swept me off my feet and showed me that haters are going to hate and you just have to keep your charm and  true beauty. Oh, how you've taught me. 

We started our journey by taking the slow ferry with "Ferry hopper" from Kimolos island to Milos for a transfer and then Milos to Santorini. in total, the tickets cost about 70 euros each person one way. I would recommend you plan and book your tickets before your trip! you can collect your tickets in person at the ticket offices before your trip. If you are travelling from Athens, there are direct ferries and flights straight to Santorini!

Once we arrived to Santorini, we had our rental car waiting for us. We booked with "Santorini rent a car" and they were very timely and always picked up their phones when we had issues. it cost us 213 euros for 5 days with full insurance.  

We stayed in Perissa at a hotel called "Villa Anemomilos Perissa" John the owner was very friendly and the facilities were decent, there was a pool on site and the black beach was a 8 minute walk away! John checked us in himself and gave us a good amount of tips for things to see and do. We paid 260 euros for 4 nights with free parking which is very affordable for Santorini standards! Don't worry about the room, it was very clean and we even had a cute balcony facing the mountains!  Okay so with logistics out of the way, lets get to the fun part! 

## Day 1: Famous Oia for beautiful pictures and Fira by night! 

The town and port is a short walk so we felt the best place to stay would be in between. We booked two nights at Kimolis hotel for 220 euros with breakfast included and I assure you the service provided was amazing! Yes, it may seem costly, but its a great location if you fancy swimming by the port or a walk around the town exploring the small streets, 17th century churches, traditional Greek taverns, shops and homes. However, it is not too near to the beautiful beaches, you will need car for that! This may cost around 30 euros a day. In the summer, it gets so hot, its a good idea to have a car. We tried walking to the Rema beach with the elephant stone but after 20 minutes of walking it gets nearly unbearable in the heat. So definitely get yourself a ride!

## Beaches

Prassa beach is so beautiful and the furthest away (about 10 mins by car), but definitely worth the travel! It has white sand with turquoise waters, also organised with umbrellas and a little cafe (get yourself a nice cold Freddo cappuccino!).

You can also swim at the Psathi (port)! We saw quite a few people jumping into the clear waters! There is also Rema beach where you'll find the fisherman village (picture with colorful doors) and a great place for pictures too.Another tip is there is a nice elephant shaped rocks that you could snap a cute picture at! Some people like diving and there is a nice place for that, Karas beach!  Poliagos beach is located on the island nearest Kimolos, you will need a boat to get there (10 mins approx) that is where the wedding beach party was hosted! It is a natural beach with endangered species such as seals etc. You won't see them near the beach where people swim but maybe you could get lucky if you explored the island?

## Food & Drinks

Look for the Agora street in the town center! You will find nice bars to hang out at. Also, the town center, which the Greeks call the 'platia', is where you'll find taverns with yummy Greek food. Although, we only spent the weekend in **Kimolos** we felt it was an **authentic experience**.

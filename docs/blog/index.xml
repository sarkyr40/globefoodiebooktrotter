      <description>Nasi goreng in english would mean fried rice. So, you would have definitely tried this dish if you have ordered Malaysian fried rice before. Today was the kind of day that we were craving for food from my home.</description>

      <description>I was hooked from the very first page. This book looks at 3 peopleâ€™s perspective on racism. It involves:
 an African American nurse, a neo-nazi and his wife who loses their baby and blame the nurse for what happened and how they take her to court for murder and the nurse is represented by a white American lawyer who refuses to discuss racism as defense in a court room.</description>

<!--# This is another post-->
We spent Saturday in Killarney catching up with friends from my university. I was never very good with goodbyes despite the time spent apart, I always feel this little bit of sadness. Reminds me of when my dad would say "I'll see you soon". I made some good and kind friends from University, although itâ€™s been a rough year for me personally, we've had some good times together and I wish them the best! Just a little tribute to our time together I will give each of them a little introduction.

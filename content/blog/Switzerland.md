title: My top 10 favourite places to visit in Switzerland 
---
Everyone has their own opinion as to which places are their favourites. I have a few international friends and their lists included some of the places I loved too. This assures me about my top 10 favourites, and I am happy to share them with you for your next trip! However, if I should visit new places in the future, I am sure this list will be updated as there are many more beautiful spots to visit in Switzerland. Also, do note that Thun would have made this list, except I live here! So, I believe visiting Thun deserves its own story.

**Lucerne**

A small city in Switzerland known for its covered Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge). A walk through the old town with colourful murals will be lovely in any season. Lake Lucerne is also beautiful surrounded by snow-capped mountains.

**Rhein falls**

We went to the Rhein falls just north of Zurich in the summer. It is known as Europe’s largest waterfalls. The force of the water at the falls were strong moving through a large rock. To enter from the castle and get a closer look of the falls, it costs 5 CHF per person. Few also suggest taking the boats so you will be closer to the falls and feel the rush of the water, however we chose to avoid it this time due to the crowds.

**Interlaken Harder Kulm** 

Interlaken is always a tourist favourite! To get a good view from the top of Interlaken, you should take a funicular up to harder kulm. It is 1,322 metres above sea level, you will have a lovely view of Lake Brienz and Lake Thun, or enjoy views of the mountains; Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau.

**Bern**

Walking through the streets of Bern is my favorite thing to do. You will feel like you are walking through history, the medieval city center of Bern is a UNESCO world heritage site. You also cannot miss the zytglogge and the bear pits where you will spot the cute brown bears who live here.  Take a nice walk up to Rosengarten, in the spring and summer you will see colorful roses bloom. The highlight would be the view of Bern city, and while you’re there, you could have a glass of wine at the restaurant or have yourself a picnic in the summer! The Aare river is also a favorite place to be in the Summer. You could head down to Freibad Marzili for a lazy float down the river. If you fancy an adventure, rent a boat in Thun Schwabis and raft down towards Bern and get thrilled by the famous Uttigen rapids!

**Leukerbad**

Winter is the best season in Switzerland! Imagine snowy mountains, glühwein and Christmas markets. Last year, we spent the night in Leukerbad and fell in love with top views and the popular thermalbad is worth it. Soaking in warm water while surrounded by snow capped mountains is a dream. We also took a walk on the frozen Daubensee!

**Niesen**

In the Spring, we took a hike up Niesen mountain in the Bernese Oberland. The views of lake Thun and lake Brienz are spectacular and the best ones I have seen so far! If you are lucky you could catch people paragliding near you. You will not regret the 2.5-hour hike one way. Take the funicular up if you do not fancy working it.

**Lugano** 

This Summer, we visited Italian speaking Switzerland to get a taste of something different within the same country. We felt like we were in Italy, yet there were characteristics of Switzerland we loved. The best of both worlds in one place. I would highly recommend doing a climb up Monte Bre or Monte Salvatore to get amazing views of the city. In the city there is also a nice park called Parco Ciani to have a picnic or have a swim at the mini “beach” in the park. If you have more time and love to explore culture, there is a nice village 20 minutes away by boat called Gandria with a nice olive tree trail with small paved streets.

**Golden pass belle epoque train to Montreux**

Ever feel like going back in time and enjoying the view of the famous views of snowcapped mountains and the lake? The belle epoque train takes you through the golden pass from Zweisimmen towards Montreux, it is a treat to marvel over. It was just before Christmas; we took the opportunity to visit the famous Montreux Christmas market too. I would highly recommend a nice slow walk along the lake to chillon castle.

**Oeschinensee Kandersteg**

This was one of my favourite day trips in Switzerland. You can do a hike up from Kandersteg town to Oeschinensee. When you get up there, there is a mini toboggan ride that takes you on a small ride with amazing views and cows grazing nearby. The lake is so still, you can see the reflection of the Rocky Mountains.

**Zermatt**

One of my best experiences in Switzerland comes from a small village in the Valais region. Zermatt is beyond spectacular, words cannot describe it. We went snowboarding with views of Matterhorn. Everyday was an adventure with top views. If you visit in the Summer, you could enjoy the views of Matterhorn from Gornergrat or my tip would be to stop at Riffelsee and enjoy the view of Matterhorn with the lake! It was mind-blowing to be surrounded by glaciers and Matterhorn.

title: Cretan Dreams
---
All my life I've said I would get married in Crete. I would lie in bed with my best friend talking about my wedding to an amazing man in a small church in the middle of nowhere. Today, my dreams came true. Crete was everything I thought it would be and more. We were walking through the historical streets and visiting monasteries and spectacular beaches and it got me thinking... I did not need a wedding to fulfill the dream, I had my dream right beside me. This post is dedicated to the highlights of our **8 day trip** and the places you should not miss! 

**Basic Tips:**
Rent a car as the island is huge and you will see nothing without one. (We rented with SK rentals and everything went smoothly). 
April is the best time to visit with nice sunny weather (20-24 degrees) and less tourists
Split your days between the three major cities: Chania, Rethymnon and Heraklion
